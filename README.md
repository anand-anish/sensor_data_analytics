# Sensor Data Analytics

### Sensor data
Sensor data is the output of a device that detects and responds to some type of input from the physical environment. The output may be used to provide information or input to another system or to guide a process. Sensor data is in integral component of the increasing reality of the Internet of Things (IoT) environment. In the IoT scenario, almost any entity imaginable can be outfitted with a unique identifier (UID) and the capacity to transfer data over a network. The huge volume of data produced and transmitted from sensing devices can provide a lot of information but is often considered the next big data challenge for businesses. To deal with that challenge, sensor data analytics is a growing field of endeavour.
 

### Sensor Analytics
Sensor analytics is the statistical analysis of data that is created by wired or 
wireless sensors. A primary goal of sensor analytics is to detect anomalies. 
The insight that is gained by examining deviations from an established point 
of reference can have many uses, including predicting and proactively 
preventing equipment failure in a manufacturing plant, alerting a nurse in an 
electronic intensive care unit (eICU) when a patient’s bloodpressure drops, or
 allowing a data centre administrator to make data-driven decisions about 
heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC).

### HVAC (heating, ventilating/ventilation, and air conditioning)

HVAC (heating, ventilating/ventilation, and air conditioning) is the technology of indoor and vehicular environmental comfort. Its goal is to provide thermal comfort and acceptable indoor air quality. HVAC system design is a sub discipline of mechanical engineering, based on the principles of thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and heat transfer. Refrigeration is sometimes added to the field's abbreviation as HVAC&R or HVACR, or ventilating is dropped as in HACR (such as the designation of HACR-rated circuit breakers).

HVAC is an important part of residential structures such as 
single family homes, apartment buildings, hotels and senior
living facilities, medium to large industrial and office  buildi-
ngs such as skyscrapers and hospitals, on-board vessels, and 
in marine environments, where safe and healthy building 
conditions are regulated with respect to temperature and 
humidity, using fresh air from outdoors.

### BUSINESS OBJECTIVE
#### Sensor Data
A sensor is a device that measures a physical quantity and transforms it into a digital signal. Sensors are always on, capturing data at a low cost, and powering the “Internet of Things.”  
 
#### Potential Uses of Sensor Data
Sensors can be used to collect data from many sources, such as:
- To monitor machines or infrastructure such as ventilation equipment, bridges, energy meters, or airplane engines. This data can be used for predictive analytics, to repair or replace these items before they break.
- To monitor natural phenomena such as meteorological patterns, underground pressure during oil extraction, or patient vital statistics during recovery from a medical procedure.   
 
This project is based on about how to refine data from heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, and how to analyze the refined sensor data to maintain optimal building temperatures
 
#### Expected Output: 
- The company requires us to accomplish three goals with this data:
- Reduce heating and cooling expenses.
- Keep indoor temperatures in a comfortable range between 65-70 degrees.
- Identify which HVAC products are reliable, and replace unreliable equipment with those models.  
- These analysis will be very helpful for facilities department to initiate data-driven strategies to reduce energy expenditures and improve employee comfort.  
 
#### Analysis need to be performed: 
 
- Data visualization/analysis by mapping the buildings that are most frequently outside of the optimal temperature range. Calculate count of extremetemp (i.e. where the temperature was more than five degrees higher or lower than the target temperature) by each country and temprange
- Which country offices run hot (Hot offices can lead to employee complaints and reduced productivity) and which offices run cold (Cold offices cause elevated energy expenditures and employee discomfort). Calculate count of offices run in hot and count of office run in cold by country.
- Our data set includes information about the performance of five brands of HVAC equipment, distributed across many types of buildings in a wide variety of climates. We can use this data to assess the relative reliability of the different HVAC models(i.e We can see that the which model seems to regulate temperature most reliably and maintain the appropriate temperature range). Calculate count of extremetemp by hvacproduct   .
